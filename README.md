## Abstract
Securing networks against advanced attacks has become a critical challenge in today’s digital landscape. This research project addresses this challenge by focusing on advanced attack detection and the development of resilient defense mechanisms. The objective is to enhance network security by identifying and mitigating sophisticated attack vectors, such as:

- **ICMP Flood Attacks**
- **SMURF Attacks**
- **DNS Attacks**
- **SYN Attacks**
- **VLAN Hopping Attacks**

The project involves comprehensive analysis of these attack patterns to understand their characteristics and potential impact on network infrastructure. Using advanced detection techniques—such as anomaly detection, behavior analysis, and network traffic analysis—effective mechanisms are developed to detect and identify these attacks in real-time. Resilient defense mechanisms are also devised to minimize the impact of successful attacks and ensure network availability and integrity.
